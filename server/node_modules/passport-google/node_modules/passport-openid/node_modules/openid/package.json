  "readme": "# OpenID for node.js\n\nOpenID for node.js is (yes, you guessed it) an OpenID implementation for node.js. \n\nHighlights and features include:\n\n- Full OpenID 1.0/1.1/2.0 compliant Relying Party (client) implementation\n- Very simple API\n- Simple extension points for association state\n\n## Download\n\nThe library can be [reviewed and retrieved from GitHub](http://github.com/havard/node-openid).\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you use [`npm`](http://npmjs.org), simply do `npm install openid`.\n\nOtherwise, you can grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/havard/node-openid) \nand \n\n## Examples\n\nInstead of walking through step-by-step, here's a very simple server \nusing OpenID for node.js for authentication:\n\n```javascript\nvar openid = require('openid');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar querystring = require('querystring');\nvar relyingParty = new openid.RelyingParty(\n    'http://example.com/verify', // Verification URL (yours)\n    null, // Realm (optional, specifies realm for OpenID authentication)\n    false, // Use stateless verification\n    false, // Strict mode\n    []); // List of extensions to enable and include\n\n\nvar server = require('http').createServer(\n    function(req, res)\n    {\n        var parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url);\n        if(parsedUrl.pathname == '/authenticate')\n        { \n          // User supplied identifier\n          var query = querystring.parse(parsedUrl.query);\n          var identifier = query.openid_identifier;\n\n          // Resolve identifier, associate, and build authentication URL\n          relyingParty.authenticate(identifier, false, function(error, authUrl)\n              {\n                if (error)\n                {\n                  res.writeHead(200);\n                  res.end('Authentication failed: ' + error);\n                }\n                else if (!authUrl)\n                {\n                  res.writeHead(200);\n                  res.end('Authentication failed');\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                  res.writeHead(302, { Location: authUrl });\n                  res.end();\n                }\n              });\n        }\n        else if(parsedUrl.pathname == '/verify')\n        {\n            // Verify identity assertion\n            // NOTE: Passing just the URL is also possible\n            relyingParty.verifyAssertion(req, function(error, result)\n            {\n              res.writeHead(200);\n              res.end(!error && result.authenticated \n                  ? 'Success :)'\n                  : 'Failure :(');\n            });\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Deliver an OpenID form on all other URLs\n            res.writeHead(200);\n            res.end('<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>'\n                + '<form method=\"get\" action=\"/authenticate\">'\n                + '<p>Login using OpenID</p>'\n                + '<input name=\"openid_identifier\" />'\n                + '<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\" />'\n                + '</form></body></html>');\n        }\n    });\nserver.listen(80);\n```\n\nA more elaborate example including utilizing extensions can be found in `sample.js` in the GitHub repository.\n\n## Supported Extensions\nThis library comes with built-in support for the following OpenID extensions:\n\n - The Simple Registration (SREG) 1.1 extension is implemented as `openid.SimpleRegistration`\n - The Attribute Exchange (AX) 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.AttributeExchange`\n - The OAuth 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.OAuthHybrid`\n - The User Interface 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.UserInterface`\n\n## Storing association state\n\nTo provide a way to save/load association state, you need to mix-in two functions in\nthe `openid` module:\n\n - `saveAssociation(provider, type, handle, secret, expiry_time_in_seconds, callback)` is called when a new association is established during authentication. The callback should be called with any error as its first argument (or `null` if no error occured).\n - `loadAssociation(handle, callback)` is used to retrieve the association identified by `handle` when verification happens. The callback should be called with any error as its first argument (and `null` as the second argument), or an object with the keys `provider`, `type`, `secret` if the association was loaded successfully.\n\nThe `openid` module includes default implementations for these functions using a simple object to store the associations in-memory.\n\n## Caching discovered information\n\nThe verification of a positive assertion (i.e. an authenticated user) can be sped up significantly by avoiding the need for additional provider discoveries when possible. In order to achieve, this speed-up, node-openid needs to cache its discovered providers. You can mix-in two functions to override the default cache, which is an in-memory cache utilizing a simple object store:\n  \n  - `saveDiscoveredInformation(key, provider, callback)` is used when saving a discovered provider.  The following behavior is required:\n    - The `key` parameter should be uses as a key for storing the provider - it will be used as the lookup key when loading the provider. (Currently, the key is either a claimed identifier or an OP-local identifier, depending on the OpenID context.)\n    - When saving fails for some reason, `callback(error)` is called with `error` being an error object specifying what failed.\n    - When saving succeeds, `callback(null)` is called.\n\n  - `loadDiscoveredInformation(key, callback)` is used to load any previously discovered information about the provider for an identifier. The following behavior is required:    \n      - When no provider is found for the identifier, `callback(null, null)` is called (i.e. it is not an error to not have any data to return).\n      - When loading fails for some reason, `callback(error, null)` is called with `error` being an error string specifying why loading failed.\n      - When loading succeeds, `callback(null, provider)` is called with the exact provider object that was previously stored using `saveDiscoveredInformation`.\n\n## License\n\nOpenID for node.js is licensed under the MIT license.
